   - Line 32 -> Cryptocurrency symbol np "SHIBUSDT".
   - Line 43 -> What operation should BOT SELL or BUY trade start with? np. "BUY"
   - Line 44 -> Budget expressed in USDT, e.g. "50"
   - Line 45 -> Cryptocurrency balance for sale, e.g. "342123.0"
   - Line 70 -> Change only the value (75) ```float (df_Main.loc [0, "RSI"]) > 75``` This is the upper limit of the RSI indicator when the cryptocurrency is to be sold.
   - Line 75 -> Change only the value (25) ```elif float (df_Main.loc [0, "RSI"]) < 25``` This is the lower limit of the RSI indicator when the cryptocurrency is to be bought.
